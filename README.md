Simply Express Generator is a simple command-line utility for generating barebones Express/TypeScript projects. If you're tired of existing Express project generators that are either outdated or too bloated, this utility is for you. 

## Features

- Quick setup with TypeScript, Jest, ESLint. ✅
- Personalized folder organization. 🚧
- Simple command to generate a new project. ✅

## Getting Started

1. Install Simply Express Generator globally via npm:

    ```bash
    npm install -g simply-express-generator
    ```

2. Generate a new project:

    ```bash
    simply-express-generator new <project-name>
    ```

This will create a new folder with the specified project name and set up a base Express/TypeScript project inside.
